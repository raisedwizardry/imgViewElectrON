# imgViewON
imgViewON is a simple and easy to use image viewer. A program to view images without bothersome editing options

## What it does
The main purpose of imgViewON is to open the major image file types (jpeg, png, gif, bmp and several others.) It will quickly display the image file without a border or top menu bar. It uses the bottom and right sides of the image to resize the image, the top and left sides to move the image and the center to close the image.

## Main Features
Displays a selected image without a border or top menu bar
Invisible resize bars at bottom, right, bottom-right of the displayed image
Move window handles at the top and left of the displayed image
Right click at the center of the image to quickly close the displayed image

## Usage

When an image is opened using imgViewON you will see the opened image on the screen you can then use the whole image to manipulate the image window. It will always scale using the original aspect ratio. Smaller images will scale larger than they actually are for better visibility. Very large images will scale down depending on the screen size you are viewing on again for better visibility.

The below diagram shows the sections of the image you can use to change the size and location of the image.

Moving Window: moving the image window is done by clicking and dragging the top and left sides of the image.

Resizing Left and Right: Clicking and dragging on the right side of the image will resize right and left.

Resizing Up and Down: Clicking and dragging the bottom of the image will resize up and down.

Resizing Diagonally: clicking and dragging the bottom right corner will resize diagonally.

Closing Window: My personal favorite part. Closing is done by right clicking anywhere in the center of the window.
